# Spam Email Classification

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails based on the content of the emails. It consists of two main components:

1. **EmailCSVParser**: Parses a CSV file containing emails labeled as spam or ham (not spam), and extracts word counts for both categories.
2. **SpamClassification**: Uses the parsed data to train a Naive Bayes classifier and classify new emails as spam or ham.
